# This project is a textual analysis of two gathered corpus of texts drawn from two pools: spoken language (including interviews, phone calls, daily conversations) and written language (including text, email, letters, newletters etc). The project draws on principles from different areas like digital humanities, text mining, and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the difference between the two pools of data. It uses Mathematica as the main tool to understand the different structural componets of text on multiple levels going from each word to sentences, and to paragraphs aas whole. Observations are documented and reported in the attached mathematica file.
